# Description
A python library for machine learning written from skratch

⚠️ This library made for learning reason

# Library dependencies
- numpy

# Plan for the future
- basic implementation for a dense layer
- generic backpropagation algorithm
- activation layer
    - ReLU
    - Sigmoid
    - Tanh
    - Leaky ReLU
    - Softmax
- convolution layer ( built in flattern )
- dropout layer
- pooling layer
- recurrent layer
- normalization layer
- embedding layer

I have some hand written document about neural network and backpropogation what I did for this project ( mainly math )
