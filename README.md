# Description
A python library for machine learning written from skratch

⚠️ This library made for learning reason

# Library dependencies
- numpy

# Implemented features
- basic implementation for a dense layer
- ✅ activation layer
    - ✅ ReLU
    - ✅ Sigmoid
    - ✅ Tanh
    - ✅ Leaky ReLU
    - ❌ Softmax

# Plan for the future
- generic backpropagation algorithm
- convolution layer ( built in flattern )
- dropout layer
- pooling layer
- recurrent layer
- normalization layer
- embedding layer

I have some hand written document about neural network and backpropogation what I did for this project ( mainly math )
